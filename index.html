        <h4>Education is the basis of all progress. It is for this very reason that we forayed into education. Over a decade and a half of experience has taught us that progress is possible only, if men and women are equally well-educated.

            The entire purpose of education is not to restrict itself to imparting bookish knowledge only but inculcate humanitarian values like wisdom, compassion, courage, humility, integrity and reliability in a student.

            We, just like you, believe in holistic education for your child, encompassing – academics, co-curricular activities, sports education and life-skills learning. Our endeavor is to strike a balance between state-of-the-art infrastructure and an internationally acceptable education.

            At Seth Hirachand Mutha School we impart education that is based on conscience and we rear a breed of young minds that are bustling with self confidence, motivation and ever ready to take up challenges.

            The campus, sports and academic facilities all bear testimony to this effort. In order to promote an internationally acceptable education, our key focus has been on faculty development – providing continuous teacher training in order to deliver real value education and excellence in academics. Teachers are trained not only to teach well but are also expected to inspire confidence and trust in their students and become role models. Further, the School inculcates in the students a respect for tradition and ensures discipline and good manners.

            Seth Hirachand Mutha School encourages students to learn about themselves and their constantly changing environment, while at the same time offering support and guidance as they practise decision-making and social skills.

            We are confident that this school is the best place for your child. We welcome your active interest and involvement in the progress and activities of your child. We look forward to your continuous support.</h4>

        <h4>Education is a shared commitment between dedicated teachers, motivated students and enthusiastic parents with high expectations

            We believe that effective teachers:

            Demonstrate ongoing professional growth in order to increase the quality of instruction;
            Collaborate with colleagues to share and discuss exemplary practices, interpret student performance data, and design assessments that promote twenty-first century skills.
            We believe that successful students:

            Communicate in a meaningful way for a variety of purposes and audiences;
            Demonstrate a sensitivity to the precision and nuances of written, visual, and aural medium through comprehension, interpretation, and evaluation;
            Employ critical and creative thinking skills to solve problems; and
            Pose questions, examine possibilities, and apply skills to find solutions to authentic issues.
            Make positive choices related to physical and mental wellness; and
            Contribute to the local and global community in a collaborative and respectful manner
            In conclusion, I wish you all a wonderful school year. If I can be of any assistance, please do not hesitate to contact me and know that my door is always open. I can be reached at shmutha@hotmail.com . Also I am honored to serve as your principal.</h4>
